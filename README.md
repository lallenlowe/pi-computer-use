Codex-style computer use for [Pi](https://pi.dev/) on macOS.

`pi-computer-use` gives Pi agents a semantic computer-use surface for visible macOS windows. It prefers Accessibility (AX) targets such as `@e1`, returns semantic state after every action, and attaches screenshots only when AX coverage is too weak for reliable operation.

## Quick Start

Install the Pi package:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use@v0.2.4
```

Start Pi in interactive mode. On the first session, grant macOS permissions to:

```text
~/.pi/agent/helpers/pi-computer-use/bridge
```

Required permissions:

- Accessibility
- Screen Recording

Some browser automation paths use JavaScript from Apple Events. If the browser blocks that, Pi surfaces a model-readable hint asking the user to enable **Allow JavaScript from Apple Events** in the browser's developer menu, then retry.

Then call `screenshot` first in a Pi session. It selects the controlled window and returns the latest semantic state, including AX refs such as `@e1` when available. If the target app/window is ambiguous, use `list_apps` and `list_windows` first.

```ts
list_apps()
list_windows({ app: "Safari" })
screenshot({ window: "@w1" })
click({ window: "@w1", ref: "@e1" })
set_text({ ref: "@e2", text: "hello" })
```

Use `/computer-use` in Pi to inspect the effective config and config sources.

## What It Adds to Pi

- Public tools: `list_apps`, `list_windows`, `screenshot`, `click`, `double_click`, `move_mouse`, `drag`, `scroll`, `keypress`, `type_text`, `set_text`, `wait`, `arrange_window`, `computer_actions`, `apple_script`, `wake_window`, `surface_window`, `launch_app`.
- AX target refs in tool results, with capabilities such as `canSetValue`, `canPress`, `canFocus`, `canScroll`, and `adjust`.
- Stable window refs from `list_windows`, with explicit targeting such as `screenshot({ window: "@w1" })` and `click({ window: "@w1", ref: "@eN" })`.
- State IDs for stale-action detection.
- Deterministic window layout through `arrange_window` presets or explicit frames.
- Optional screenshot attachment mode with `image: "auto" | "always" | "never"`.
- Ref-first actions such as `click({ ref: "@eN" })`, `scroll({ ref: "@eN" })`, and `set_text({ ref: "@eN", text })`.
- Batched actions through `computer_actions`, with one post-action semantic state update plus per-action execution metadata.
- Execution metadata that reports the strategy used (`ax_press`, `ax_set_value`, `coordinate_event_click`, `per_pid_keypress`, …), AX attempt/success, and fallback usage.
- Full pointer and keyboard primitive coverage for common GUI flows, with AX-first equivalents where available.
- Browser-aware targeting, including isolated browser window preference where appropriate.
- Per-PID input delivery for clicks, keypresses, text, scroll, and drag — events land in the target app's queue without changing the user's frontmost or moving the system cursor.
- A `requireFocusChangeApproval` gate on the only two tools that can change frontmost (`surface_window`, `launch_app({activate:true})`): `ctx.ui.confirm` by default, skippable with `focus_auto_approve`.
- Official QA benchmark harness in [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/README.md).

## Examples

Prefer AX refs over coordinates when a matching target exists:

```ts
click({ ref: "@e1" })
scroll({ ref: "@e3", scrollY: 600 })
```

Use coordinates from the latest screenshot only when there is no suitable AX target:

```ts
click({ x: 320, y: 180, stateId: "..." })
```

Replace text through AX value semantics:

```ts
set_text({ ref: "@e2", text: "https://example.com" })
keypress({ keys: ["Enter"] })
```

Batch obvious actions when no intermediate inspection is needed:

```ts
computer_actions({
  stateId: "...",
  actions: [
    { type: "click", ref: "@e1" },
    { type: "set_text", ref: "@e2", text: "https://example.com" },
    { type: "keypress", keys: ["Enter"] }
  ]
})
```

See [docs/usage.md](./docs/usage.md) for the full workflow and tool patterns.

## How It Works

`pi-computer-use` has three pieces:

1. The Pi extension in [`extensions/computer-use.ts`](./extensions/computer-use.ts) registers the public tools and `/computer-use` command.
2. The TypeScript bridge in [`src/bridge.ts`](./src/bridge.ts) manages the current window, capture IDs, AX refs, fallback policy, batching, and execution metadata.
3. The native Swift helper in [`native/macos/bridge.swift`](./native/macos/bridge.swift) talks to macOS Accessibility, ScreenCaptureKit, AppKit, and CoreGraphics.

The result is semantic-first GUI control: Pi sees useful AX targets first, falls back to screenshots only when needed, and reports the execution path of each action.

## Development & Benchmarks

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run checks:

```bash
npm test
```

Run the local checkout in Pi without loading another installed copy:

```bash
pi --no-extensions -e .
```

Run the default QA benchmark:

```bash
npm run benchmark:qa
```

Run the wider benchmark that may open apps:

```bash
npm run benchmark:qa:full
```

## Release & Install Notes

The package is published on npm as `@injaneity/pi-computer-use`.

```bash
npm install @injaneity/pi-computer-use
npm install @injaneity/pi-computer-use@0.2.4
```

Pi installs should pin a GitHub release tag:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use@v0.2.4
pi install -l git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use@v0.2.4
pi install /absolute/path/to/pi-computer-use
```

Remove:

```bash
pi remove git:github.com/injaneity/pi-computer-use@v0.2.4
npm remove @injaneity/pi-computer-use
```

For a different release, replace `v0.2.4` or `0.2.4` with the version you want to pin.
