description: Interact with macOS GUI windows using semantic screenshots, clicks, typing, and waits. Use this when the task requires operating a visible app window.

# Computer Use

Use these tools when shell/file tools are not enough and you need to operate a macOS app window directly.

## Core workflow

1. **Call `screenshot` first** to pick the target window and get current UI state.
2. If the latest screenshot includes AX target refs, use those first for `click`. Use coordinates from the **latest screenshot** only when no suitable AX target is available.
3. To discover/switch apps or windows, use `list_apps`, `list_windows`, then `screenshot({ window: "@w1" })` or pass `window` to action tools.
4. For text input, prefer `set_text({ ref: "@eN", text })` when the screenshot exposes a matching AX text target. Use click + `type_text({ text })` when you need insertion/cursor semantics.
5. Use `keypress({ keys })` for Enter, Tab, Escape, arrows, deletion, and shortcuts. Enter/Escape/Space try semantic AX actions first when possible.
6. Use `navigate_browser({ window, url })` for direct browser navigation when you know the URL; prefer it over address-bar keystrokes.
7. Use `computer_actions({ actions })` to batch obvious actions like click + type + Enter when no intermediate screenshot is needed.
7. Every successful action returns the **latest semantic state**. If AX targets are missing, sparse, or ambiguous, an image is attached for vision fallback.

## Practical rules

- Action tools operate on the **current controlled window** by default, or an explicit `window` ref/id when provided.
- For browsers, prefer a **separate window** for agent work, not a new tab in the user's current window.
- In strict AX mode, do not bootstrap a new browser window; use an already-open dedicated browser window instead.
- `screenshot` may include compact AX targets like `@e1`; prefer refs for `click({ ref: "@e1" })` and `set_text({ ref: "@e1", text })` whenever a listed target matches what you want. For `set_text`, prefer targets marked `canSetValue`.
- Coordinates are **window-relative screenshot pixels** (top-left origin).
- `stateId` is optional. If provided and stale, refresh with `screenshot`.
- `type_text` inserts text at the current cursor/selection. Use `set_text` when you need to replace an AX text value; prefer a ref over relying on focus.
- `scroll` can use an AX ref marked `scroll` or screenshot-relative coordinates from the latest screenshot; refs are preferred in stealth mode. `drag` can use a ref marked `adjust` plus a path for sliders/steppers, otherwise it uses screenshot-relative path points. `move_mouse`, `double_click`, and coordinate clicks use screenshot-relative coordinates from the latest screenshot.
- For shortcut sequences, use chord strings like `keypress({ keys: ["Command+L", "Enter"] })`; reserve `["Command", "L"]` for a single chord call. In stealth mode, only keypresses with safe AX equivalents, such as focused Enter/Escape/Space actions, can run. In browser windows, `Command+L` tries to focus the address/search field via AX so the next `type_text` can replace it without raw keyboard input.
- `computer_actions` executes one to twenty actions and returns one state update plus per-action execution metadata, including whether each action used the `stealth` or `default` implementation variant. Do not batch if the next action depends on seeing an intermediate result.
- `wait({ ms })` pauses and then returns the latest semantic state for polling/loading states.
- Accessibility permission is mandatory for actions.
- Screen Recording permission is mandatory for screenshots and model vision context.
- Public tool surface is `list_apps`, `list_windows`, `screenshot`, `click`, `double_click`, `move_mouse`, `drag`, `scroll`, `keypress`, `type_text`, `set_text`, `wait`, `arrange_window`, `navigate_browser`, `computer_actions`.
- Run `/computer-use` to show effective config. Config files are `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-computer-use.json` globally and `.pi/computer-use.json` per project.
- `browser_use=false` blocks control of known browser apps. `stealth_mode=true` requires background-safe AX execution.
- Default mode has built-in screenshot/vision grounding and is AX-first with fallback only when a control cannot be completed semantically.
- Opt-in stealth mode (`PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH=1` or `PI_COMPUTER_USE_STRICT_AX=1`) exposes the widest safe subset: AX/background-safe operations run, but non-AX fallbacks are blocked.
- In stealth mode, operation must stay background-safe: no second screen or virtual display, no foreground activation, no raw keyboard/pointer events, and no physical cursor takeover.
- **Stealth mode is the "drive while the user works" mode.** When `stealth_mode=true` the bridge will never raise a window above the user's frontmost window, change the frontmost app, move the system cursor, or post raw keyboard events. Tool calls that would require breaking that contract fail fast with a `strict_mode` error so the model can pick a different path. The contract holds across `click`, `double_click`, `set_text`, `type_text`, `keypress`, `scroll`, `drag`, `move_mouse`, `arrange_window`, `navigate_browser`, and `computer_actions`.
- If a `screenshot` result includes an `--- App-specific instructions for ... ---` block, prefer the guidance there over generic heuristics for that app. The instructions are hand-written for surprising behaviors (selection rules, modifier conventions, irreversible actions) the AX tree alone won't tell you about. Apps without instructions are normal — work it out from AX targets and the screenshot as usual.

## When errors happen

If an action reports stale state, target mismatch, or missing target/window, call `screenshot` again to refresh and continue.

If a browser reports that JavaScript from Apple Events is disabled, stop and prompt the user to enable "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" in the browser's developer menu. Retry the browser action after the user confirms it is enabled.
